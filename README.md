# Syncventory Todo App

Welcome to the SyncVentory Todo App project! This project is designed to help you familiarize yourself with the key technologies used in our main SyncVentory application. By building this todo app, you'll gain hands-on experience with our tech stack and be better prepared to contribute to the main project.

### Project Aim

The goal of this project is to create a functional todo app that demonstrates your understanding of:

1. [React](https://react.dev)
2. [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
3. [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com)
4. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
5. [Redux Toolkit Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org)
6. User Experience
7. User Interface design

### Project Requirements

Your task is to create a fully functional todo app with the following features:

1. **Todo List Display**: Show a list of todos with their titles and completion status.
2. **Add Todo**: Implement a form to add new todos.
3. **Edit Todo**: Allow users to edit existing todos.
4. **Delete Todo**: Provide a way to remove todos from the list.
5. **Mark as Complete**: Toggle the completion status of todos.
6. **Filtering**: Implement filters to show all, active, or completed todos.
7. **Routing**: Use React Router to create separate routes for viewing all todos, active todos, and completed todos.
8. **Styling**: Use Radix UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling. Try to match the general look and feel of the main SyncVentory app.
9. **State Management**: Utilize Redux Toolkit Query for state management and API calls.

### Mock API Service

To simulate real-world conditions, we've provided a mock API service. This allows you to make API requests as if you were connecting to a real backend, but all data is stored in the browser's localStorage.

The mock API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/todos`: Fetch all todos
- `GET /api/todos/:id`: Fetch a single todo
- `POST /api/todos`: Create a new todo
- `PUT /api/todos/:id`: Update an existing todo
- `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Delete a todo

Each API call includes a simulated random delay to mimic real network conditions.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `yarn`
3. Start the development server with `yarn dev`
4. Begin building your todo app!

### Evaluation Criteria

If you complete the main requirements, try these bonus challenges:

1. Implement drag-and-drop reordering of todos.
2. Add user authentication.

### Bonus Challenges

Your implementation will be evaluated based on:

1. Correct use of the specified technologies
2. Code organization and cleanliness
3. User interface design
4. Proper error handling and edge case management
5. Adherence to React and functional programming best practices

### Submission

When you've completed the project, please:

- Push your code to a new GitHub repository
- Deploy your app to a platform like Vercel or Netlify
- Submit the links to your repository and deployed app

### Additional Notes

- Feel free to add extra features or improvements beyond the basic requirements.
- Don't hesitate to ask questions if you're stuck or need clarification.
- Remember to commit your code regularly and write clear commit messages.

Good luck, and happy coding!
